# IMPLEMENTATION-OF-CHATBOT-USING-NLP-AICTE-INTERNSHIP-week-1-2-3-

Week 1: This week focused on laying the foundation for a chatbot using NLP. Essential Python libraries like nltk, scikit-learn, and streamlit were installed. Text preprocessing with nltk (including tokenization) and data setup for managing intents were completed. TF-IDF Vectorization and Logistic Regression were introduced for intent classification. Streamlit was selected to build an interactive user interface.

Week 2: The chatbot was enhanced with intent classification and response generation capabilities. A dataset of intents with patterns and responses was created. TF-IDF Vectorizer was used for feature extraction, and Logistic Regression was implemented as the classifier. Chatbot logic was built to handle user inputs, predict intents, and provide appropriate responses. Testing was performed successfully on user inputs like "which music you like?" to ensure accuracy.

Week 3: This week focused on practical implementation. The project folder was opened in VS Code, and two key files were created: intents.json for defining intents and responses, and chatbot.py for coding the chatbot logic. The intents were written in intents.json, and the chatbot functionality was coded in chatbot.py. The project was then launched successfully using Streamlit, demonstrating a functioning chatbot.
